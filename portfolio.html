      <h2>Work Activity Affinity Diagramming</h2>
      <p class="description">
        One of the first steps in putting together a UX design is to create an affinity diagram.
        In order to analyze the customer's thought patterns and extract potential needs, I created a work activity affinity
        diagram out of the notes from interviews and observations from the local community.

      <h2>Personas Construction</h2>
      <p class="description">
        In order to further empathize with the potential users of the application, I created personas based on the demographic
        of user that would be expected to benefit from the application. The specific traits for each persona were derived from
        the raw observational and interview data collected from the Virginia Tech community.

      <h2>Application Wireframes</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Moving into the designing phase, a great way to begin the actualization of an application's design is to represent
        the application's layout in a wireframe. This allows the designer to visualize the application's layout and structure,
        and gives me a better idea about what potential features are lacking, redundant, or points of failure.

      <h2>Application Prototype</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Once the necessary information has been gathered and extracted based on the performance of the application's wireframes with certain clients,
        I created a prototype of the application using Proto.io. This prototype was then tested with a few users to see how intuitive and useful the application
        would be in true implementation.
